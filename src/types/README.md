# TypeScript Types

This directory contains shared TypeScript type definitions.

## Structure

```
types/
├── api.ts        # API request/response types
├── models.ts     # Database model types
├── components.ts # Component prop types
└── index.ts      # Export all types
```

## Guidelines

- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use types for unions/intersections
- Export all types from index.ts
- Document complex types with comments
